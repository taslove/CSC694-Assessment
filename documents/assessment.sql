NCC Biology B.S. students had higher scores than the Biology B.A. students by approximately one standard deviation, suggesting that they understood and retained more core biology knowledge. This was also true in each of the four subject areas, with the B.S. students having scores from seven to 19 points higher. Curiously, the B.S. students particularly had higher scores in the cell biology and molecular biology/genetics areas (15 and 19 points, respectively) than in the organismal biology and evolution/ecology areas (eight and seven points, respectively).

If that score is omitted, the NCC B.A. average increases four full points (but remains well below the national mean). Naturally, we would always like our students to do better and are hopeful that we will see improvements in the future. As such, these data form a baseline for future comparisons. Given that much of this weakness comes from poorer performances in the cell biology and molecular biology/genetics areas, we might consider recommending or requiring more coursework in these areas in the future.

A committee of two CSC faculty members examined the students'' solutions  to see how well they met the two main criteria that are commonly used to characterise the goodness of algorithmic solutions: correctness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe solutions were graded using a rubric for correctness that distinguished 5 levels of correctness. The detailed description of the 5 levels is on file in the CSC department, here I will just mention that level 1 reflected a solution that was incorrect;  level 3 reflected a  solution that was based on the right approach, and the solution, although not correct, could be easily repaired (the incorrectness of the solution stemmed from some oversight, or was a result of some small gaps in the student''s knowledge or understanding);  level 5 reflected a solution that was completely correct, or very nearly so. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe two faculty graders assigned scores of 1 through 5 to various parts of the solutions, in accordance to the rubric.

Some students seem to be unsure of the distinction between “example” and “evidence”, while others spent valuable time devising unnecessarily complicated counterexamples.  The high success rate on the axiomatic system question indicates that our students have developed deductive reasoning skills that they can apply to solve a logical puzzle not related directly to the math content in the course.\r\n	\r\nIn the MTH 300 assessment, students seemed, for the most part, able to apply a familiar definition in an unfamiliar setting, but what surprised us is that many mistakes could be attributed to rusty calculus skills.  The poor performance on the proof-writing questions highlights the fact that MTH 300 students are in the middle of a transition at this point in the major, and that we need to find ways to help them get through that transition more quickly and more successfully.  The high scores on the axiomatic system question (which included a complete list of steps students could choose from) provide evidence that our students are somewhat comfortable using trial-and-error to (at least begin to) assemble a correct sequence of logical steps that would prove a result in which they were provided a complete list of allowable steps from which to choose.\r\n', 'For both classes we need stress to our students more emphatically that, as far as upper level math goes, often the justification is more important than the final answer.  Students seem hesitant, at first, to adapt to this notion because they’ve been trained that simply getting the correct answer is all that is important in mathematics. \r\n\r\nIf we use a similar assessment tool next year, we will likely keep the same types of questions, but work on some of the wording so that students can more easily understand what is being asked and can give us a better idea of their strengths and weaknesses in abstract thinking and proof writing.  \r\n\r\nSince time seemed to be an issue for some students we might look into alternative assessment methods for this learning outcome that will allow us to measure our major’s ability to put together a coherent argumentative (which is not necessarily best accomplished in a short amount of time).  The MTH 280 instructor may introduce some extra credit “going beyond questions” in the Reading Checks in order to give students some practice with quickly interpreting new ideas.\r\n', '', '2', '2'),

Without this score, the mean total would be 154.4. The Non-routine sub score, while improved from past years, remains well below what we would like.  \r\nWe are particularly concerned with low performance on Calculus problems.  Informal discussions with our upper level majors and among the departmental faculty, together with evidence from the ETS test, seem to suggest that students are not successfully retaining their Calculus content, the bulk of which is covered relatively early in the mathematics major.\r\nOur goal stated in the assessment plan was to, over time, raise all percentiles to 75% or better.

Introducing more non-routine problems into our calculus courses might be a way to get at both of the two areas in which are students’ scores are the lowest.

It is our hope that Maple will encourage exploration of concepts by reducing the amount of tedium involved.\r\n\r\nWe have some additional ideas in mind for the future:\r\n\r\n•	Require the problem solving seminar as part of the major and step up our efforts to encourage more of our majors to participate in the annual ACCA Calculus competition.\r\n•	Implement a series of “challenge” problems in all courses which require students to work on non routine problems.\r\n•	Strongly encourage (or possibly require) our majors to run a study table or precept for at least one Calculus class in their junior and/or senior year in order to help our students refresh their Calculus skills. \r\n•	Begin a calculus “bee” (perhaps within math club) to give our majors an opportunity to practice their skills in a fun, informal setting.\r\n', '', '2', '2'),

The average scores for each of the three Learning Outcomes was between 3.8 and 4.0 on our 5-point scale.  Students graduating with the B.A. did slightly better for each outcome with the largest difference for Learning Outcome 2.\r\nLooking at individually assessed criteria revealed some interesting observations.  Most scores were clustered together, with two exceptions.  The graduates’ performance on Criterion 8 (“Professional presentation”) was substantially higher than for the other criteria, suggesting that they were generally aware of what is expected in a professional scientific presentation and they put considerable effort into their work.  Our graduates’ performance on Criterion 1 (“Appropriate references to the literature”) was considerably weaker than all the other criteria.  Looking at the written comments from the faculty, graduates either had few sources or had selected weak sources such as citing non-scientific information.  This result suggests an obvious area for improvement in the department.  To gain further insights, we compared our graduates’ scores with other available information.  First, we find that students who have participated in our on-campus summer research program performed much better in all categories.  Most notably, these students did much better in Learning Outcome 2 due to a superior performance on Criterion 1 (4.50 vs. 3.31 average scores), which was the weakest criterion identified above.  This suggests that participation in summer research helps a student overall but particularly improves his/her ability to work with the scientific literature.  Graduates who were admitted to NCC as a first-year student substantially out-performed transfer students.  The magnitude of this effect was the largest found in these analyses.  Most notably, students admitted as first-year student scored a full point higher on Learning Outcome 4 than transfer students.  Finally, the research on which the students presented was done under a variety of different circumstances. All of these projects were done on the NCC campus under the direction of our faculty and fall into three broad categories.  Some projects were accomplished within a normal course (either BIO305 or BIO430), some projects were initiated by the individual student and some projects were part of a larger, ongoing research project.

Seminar is a class in which students from the Biology and Chemistry Departments and the Biochemistry program meet weekly to discuss research.  A major portion of this class are half-hour presentations by students, reporting on research projects that they have completed as part of their degree requirements.  During the 2008-09 academic year, presentations by biology majors were evaluated by faculty members in two ways: first, they were evaluated for a grade in BIO/CHM475; secondly, they were evaluated on an independent form (see appendix) for purposes of program assessment.  ', 'Due to the small sample sizes, the Biology B.A. and B.S. programs have been pooled for most of the analyses.  Even by looking at both programs, we still only have data on nine graduates, which should be borne in mind when considering the following data.  \r\nThe eight criteria on our evaluation form were each scored on a scale of one to five, with five being considered outstanding performance.  Learning Outcome 2 was assessed by looking at average scores for criteria one and two.  Learning Outcome 3 was assessed by looking at average scores for criteria two through six.  Learning Outcome 4 was assessed by looking at average scores for criteria six through eight.  \r\n	All Graduates	B.S. Graduates	B.A. Graduates\r\nLearning Outcome 2:	3.83	3.70	3.94\r\nLearning Outcome 3:	3.88	3.80	3.95\r\nLearning Outcome 4:	3.97	3.91	4.02\r\nOverall, we are very pleased with the performance of our graduates.  The average scores for each of the three Learning Outcomes was between 3.8 and 4.0 on our 5-point scale.  Students graduating with the B.A. did slightly better for each outcome with the largest difference for Learning Outcome 2.\r\nLooking at individually assessed criteria revealed some interesting observations.  Most scores were clustered together, with two exceptions.  The graduates’ performance on Criterion 8 (“Professional presentation”) was substantially higher than for the other criteria, suggesting that they were generally aware of what is expected in a professional scientific presentation and they put considerable effort into their work.  Our graduates’ performance on Criterion 1 (“Appropriate references to the literature”) was considerably weaker than all the other criteria.  Looking at the written comments from the faculty, graduates either had few sources or had selected weak sources such as citing non-scientific information.  This result suggests an obvious area for improvement in the department.  To gain further insights, we compared our graduates’ scores with other available information.  First, we find that students who have participated in our on-campus summer research program performed much better in all categories.  Most notably, these students did much better in Learning Outcome 2 due to a superior performance on Criterion 1 (4.50 vs. 3.31 average scores), which was the weakest criterion identified above.  This suggests that participation in summer research helps a student overall but particularly improves his/her ability to work with the scientific literature.  Graduates who were admitted to NCC as a first-year student substantially out-performed transfer students.  The magnitude of this effect was the largest found in these analyses.  Most notably, students admitted as first-year student scored a full point higher on Learning Outcome 4 than transfer students.  Finally, the research on which the students presented was done under a variety of different circumstances. All of these projects were done on the NCC campus under the direction of our faculty and fall into three broad categories.  Some projects were accomplished within a normal course (either BIO305 or BIO430), some projects were initiated by the individual student and some projects were part of a larger, ongoing research project.   For all Learning Outcomes, students who did their work as part of an ongoing project had the best performance and the students who initiated their own projects were the weakest.  \r\n\r\n	All Graduates	B.S.

A major portion of this class are student presentations, reporting on original research projects that they have completed as part of their degree requirements.  During the 2009-10 academic year, presentations by biology majors were evaluated by faculty members in two ways: first, they were evaluated for a grade in BIO/CHM475; secondly, they were evaluated on an independent form (see appendix) for purposes of program assessment.  ', 'Due to the small sample sizes, the Biology B.A. and B.S. programs have been pooled for most of the analyses.  Even by looking at both programs, we still only have data on 17 graduates, which should be borne in mind when considering the following data.  \r\n\r\nThe eight criteria on our evaluation form were each scored on a scale of one to five, with five being considered outstanding performance.  Learning Outcome 2 was assessed by looking at average scores for criteria one and two.  Learning Outcome 3 was assessed by looking at average scores for criteria two through six.  Learning Outcome 4 was assessed by looking at average scores for criteria six through eight.  \r\n\r\nOverall, we are very pleased with the performance of our graduates.  The average scores for each of the three Learning Outcomes was in the low-four range on our 5-point scale.  Students graduating with the B.A. did slightly better for each outcome with the largest difference for Learning Outcome 2, with smaller differences between the two degrees for the other Learning Outcomes. \r\n\r\nLooking at individually assessed criteria revealed some interesting observations.  Most scores were clustered together, with two exceptions.  The graduates’ performance on Criteria 2 and 8 (“Appropriate hypothesis” and “Professional presentation”) were substantially higher than for the other criteria, suggesting that they were generally aware of what is expected in initiating a line of inquiry and what is expected in a professional scientific presentation.  Interestingly, these strong scores were clearly led by our B.A. graduates.  Our graduates’ performance on Criterion 4 (“Appropriate analysis of the data”) was considerably weaker than all the other criteria.  This obviously suggests a place where the faculty could focus more attention in mentoring student projects.    ', 'Overall, we are very pleased with our graduates’ achievements.  Naturally, we would always like our students to do even better and are hopeful that we will see improvements in the future, particularly in our graduates’ ability to fully and rigorously analyze data.

In MTH 300, math minors scored 0 out of 3 on the proof-writing questions (which dealt with linear transformations and subspaces) and 2 out of 3 on the logical thinking question.  By comparison, in MTH 280 the 7 BA math majors (resp. 12 BS math majors) averaged 1.30 (resp. 2.17) out of 3 on the proof-writing questions and 1.93 (resp. 2.13) out of 3 on the logical thinking questions.  In MTH 300, the 19 math majors averaged 1.21 out of 3 on the proof-writing questions and 2.68 out of 3 on the logical thinking questions.  We note that nearly 75% of all MTH 300 students left the proof-writing questions essentially blank.  Last year, math minors in MTH 280 averaged 0.7 out of 3 on the proof-writing questions and 0.3 out of 3 on the logical thinking questions; in MTH 300, math minors averaged 1 out of 3 on the proof-writing questions and 2.3 out of 3 on the logical thinking questions.', 'Our departmental goal for our minor students’ performance (as well as for our majors) in both proof-writing and logical thinking is 2 out of 3.  This goal was met in MTH 280 for proof-writing and in MTH 300 for logical thinking, but it was not met in MTH 280 for logical thinking nor in MTH 300 for proof-writing.  The assessment in MTH 280 was included on the final exam; in MTH 300 it was administered at the end of a class period and not included in the course grade.  This, along with the fact that MTH 300 students had only 15 minutes to complete the questions (as opposed to an amount of time during the final exam period decided on by individual MTH 280 students), could explain the high number of blank responses on the MTH 300 questions.  This makes it difficult to come to any reliable conclusions regarding proof-writing for the math minors in MTH 300.   In MTH 280, the minors’ averaged (significantly) higher on the proof-writing questions than the BA math majors (this was somewhat unexpected) but slightly lower than the BS math majors, while on the logical thinking questions, the minors scored below both the BA and BS majors.  In MTH 300, as we expected based on comparative performance levels on homework, exams, etc., our minors’ scores were below those of our majors on the assessment questions; this could be explained by the fact that math majors – but not minors - are required to take MTH 280 (although MTH 280 is a highly recommended pre-requisite for MTH 300).', 'In order to solve the “blank-response” issue in the MTH 300 assessment, we will plan to make future assessment questions for minors (and majors) carry small weight in the course grade.  We feel that students will take the questions more seriously (thus giving us more meaningful data) and it could help solve the time constraint problem to some extent.  We will try to incorporate some logic puzzle practice in MTH 280 in order to boost our students’ performance above our goals; students seem to like these exercises and there is growing evidence that working on these abstract problems improves both logical thinking and proof construction abilities.   Our department will revisit discussions on expectations for minors (should they be the same or lower than those of majors?) and adjust our minors’ learning outcomes and/or assessment strategies accordingly.', '', '2', '2'),

For the MTH 341 question, one student failed to properly find the appropriate value of &#955;, and then used a binomial distribution instead of the multinomial distribution for computing the probability of defects.  The other student correctly calculated the value of &#955;, but also used an incorrect formula (which appeared to be a hybrid of the binomial and the multinomial distribution) for the defect probability.  For the MTH 342 question, each student attempted to compute the probability density function using (a different) one of 3 possible methods, but each made errors in obtaining the necessary bounds of integration.

We scored each question on a 0 – 3 scale, and sorted the results according to the students’ major or minor.  The overall averages, across all categories, for each question were 2.13 (series), 1.42 (interval of convergence), 2.19 (triangle), 1.8 (gradient), 2.05 (double integral), 2.02 (critical points).  By comparison, the averages for BS APP MTH majors were, respectively, N/A, N/A, N/A, 1, 0, 2.', 'There was only 1 self-identified BS Applied Mathematics major in the population, so drawing any meaningful conclusions is difficult.  We did, however, spot some trends among the entire population of MTH 153/254 students who participated in this assessment.  The overall results were below our goal of a 75% average (2.25 out of 3) per question, but only slightly below on 3 out of six questions.  For BA MTH majors in particular, average scores were slightly below the overall averages on 4 out of the 6 questions, but above our goal average on 2 of the MTH 153 questions.  As we expected, the average score on the MTH 153 question we identified as “non-routine” was significantly below the averages on the other questions; however, to our surprise, the average score on the MTH 254 question we identified as “non-routine” was equal to or above the averages on the other questions in all subgroups except the Applied Math majors, MTH minors and “None of the above”.   The students who performed the best, on average, were the Actuarial Science majors.  Finally, when comparing North Central MTH 254 students to Downers Grove high school students enrolled in MTH 254, we noticed that the North Central students scored just slightly lower, on average.  In some instances, students carried out appropriate problem-solving procedures and/or applied correct formulas, but errors were made in the interpretation of the results.  On the triangle problem for example, a handful of students failed to characterize the triangle as completely as they were asked (perhaps due to not reading the full question), and others seemed confused on the definition of “isosceles” versus “equilateral”.  (We assume students are familiar with this geometric terminology and therefore spend little time, if any, reviewing these definitions in the calculus sequence.)  Also on the first MTH 254 question, nearly all students were able to figure out that a gradient had to be computed, and they computed it correctly, but then a fair number neglected to multiply the answer by -1 in order to find the direction of maximum decrease (not increase).  ', 'Though below our target scores, we feel our students’ performance on this assessment was satisfactory, and so we have no plans to change our calculus instruction drastically.  We will continue to teach these courses with a mix of theory and application as these courses as serve as both the foundation for the math major and minor programs as well as support for the BS degree in many applied areas.  Applying formulas and procedures correctly is a skill required in both theoretical and applied mathematics, and the data indicates that our students, for the most part, able to decide which formulas and procedures are relevant to solving a particular problem and can carry them out successfully.  We will increase our efforts to hone students’ ability to appropriately interpret their results.  In a few years, we will re-administer this assessment to see if scores improve.', '', '2', '2'),

The average score among the Actuarial Science students on the non-routine logically thinking/application question was 1.72, while the average scores on the two proof questions were 2.28 and 1.5.  By comparison, the averages on these same three questions for the 12 Math and Applied Math majors in MTH 300 were 2.29, 2.25, and 1.42 respectively, and the averages for the 7 Math minors in MTH 300 were 2.29, 1.64 and 0.86.  We also used student scores on 2 proof-writing questions from MTH 280 (Nature of Proof in Mathematics) in Winter 2011 for comparison data.  On these two questions, the 2 Actuarial Science majors averaged 2.5 and 3, the 17 Math and Applied Math majors averaged 1.79 and 2.04, and the 3 Math minors averaged 0.33 and 1.33.', 'Our departmental goal for students’ performance on all questions was 75% (2.25 out of 3).  The Actuarial Science students fell short of this goal on the second proof-writing question and (less so) on the logic/application (non-routine) question; they exceeded our goal on the first proof-writing question.  Except for the logic/application question, the Actuarial Science students, on average, scored above their classmates in MTH 300 and significantly above their classmates in MTH 280.  \r\nOnly two of the Actuarial Science students in MTH 300 were enrolled in MTH 280 the previous term.  MTH 280 focuses specifically on developing abstract mathematical thinking and writing skills.  As MTH 280 is only a recommended prerequisite for MTH 300, many students have their first exposure to proof writing in MTH 300; this is particularly true for Actuarial Science majors who are not required to take MTH 280.  It is therefore not wholly unexpected that their averages on the proof-writing questions were lower than our target scores.  Simply put, students often need more than 10 weeks to develop reliably good proof-writing skills.\r\nWe did change the assessment format in MTH 300 this year by putting the assessment questions on the final exam.  Compared with prior years, we saw far fewer blank responses on the proof-writing questions.  Thus, we are confident that the data we collected this year, more so than in past years, is more meaningful and representative of our students’ understanding of the skills they were tested on.\r\n', 'The math department revised the learning outcomes in all of our programs last year after we submitted assessment plans based on the old outcomes.  While we expect all students majoring or minoring in math department programs (Mathematics, Actuarial Science, Applied Mathematics) to be exposed to at least a minimal amount of abstract reasoning, the department faculty decided to remove the “proof-writing” portion of the assessed learning outcome in Actuarial Science, and to fold the “completing applications” part into another learning outcome.  We felt that proof-writing was not a sufficiently substantial component of the Actuarial Science program to be one of the learning outcomes. \r\nWhen we assess learning outcomes in the future using student responses, we will continue to put the assessment questions on an exam or tell students that their answers will be scored and used as a small factor in computing their course grade.  We have noticed that this encourages students to take the assessment more seriously and it results in fewer blank responses.\r\n', '', '2', '2'),

The outcome we wanted to assess is “Students should be able to use appropriate software and technology to aid in computation and visualization.”  We originally planned to “evaluate responses to two or three questions on the MTH 256 final exam that involve using Maple (a computer algebra system) to solve differential equations, visualize solutions and explain/interpret the outcome of numerical calculations.”  After more comprehensive consideration for the overall goals of this course, we decided to drop the part of “using Maple to solve differential equations” and instead focus on the ability to “read” the graph (i.e. visualization and the interpretation part of the learning outcome).  \r\n\r\nInstead of using two or three different questions on the final exam, we used one question with four parts to cover all aspects.  This question is about reading three graphs related with the solution of a second order linear differential equation.  The phase plane is given in the graph a), the time series graph of x(t) is given in the graph b) and the time series graph of x''(t) is given in the graph c).  The questions were\r\n\r\na. Mark on the phase portrait the starting point (where t=0) for the trajectory shown.\r\nb. Add arrows for the direction on the trajectory.\r\nc. Write down the initial condition x(0), x''(0).\r\nd. Find the explicit solutions for x(t).\r\ne. Describe how the time series graph of x(t) relates to its explicit solution, especially where its behavior changes and what happens as t approaches infinity.\r\n\r\nOut of 14 possible points, the 8 students'' scores were, respectively, 6, 4, 13, 11, 14, 12, 12, 13; this averages to a 76% success rate.\r\n\r\nParts a) – c) involve visualization of the numerical solutions in different graphs.  Students need to understand how the algebraic solutions are expressed in various numerical and graphical forms.  It seems most of students understand the connection and are able to “read” the information from the graphs.  Part d) can be done either manually or by Maple, but most of students have done it manually.  Part e) is the most sophisticated part.  Most students could understand the general idea of how these three graphs linked together to reflect the nature of the solution, but only one answered the question adequately to get the full credit on it.  There is one student who had no idea of what these graphs said, another gleaned only a little relevant information from the graphs.\r\n', 'We reached our target of getting 75% in the score.  This demonstrated that we covered this area adequately in this class.  Students walk away from this class having increased understanding in the nature of solutions to differential equations, and how various graphs fit together to tell the whole story of the solutions.   We will keep using Maple in MTH 256 so that our math minors will be exposed to this powerful tool of problem solving and analysis.  The reason we did not emphasize using Maple to solve differential equations is more of assessment problem.  Maple is very powerful in solving differential equations; if Maple is allowed on the exam to solve differential equations, students will not need to learn much else in order to pass the exams.  But learning to investigate differential equations analytically has its own virtues which cannot be replaced by using Maple.   We will need to consider how to balance teaching mathematical thinking, symbolic manipulation and using technology in a more general way.  Maple can take derivatives, but we still teach and test students to do them manually in Calculus I.  Maple can integrate, we still teach and test students to do them manually in Calculus II.  The question goes beyond this one course.', 'We will need to have departmental wide discussion on our goals in using technology in each course and how the technology contributes to conceptual understanding and mathematical maturity of students.

Although the math majors we assessed this year (with the Major Field Test in Mathematics) all began under previous catalogs, many of them took some of the advanced courses we added to the math major (such as Differential Equations, Complex Variables, Topology, and the Problem Solving Seminar), and this may be one reason for the 11-point increase in the ASMS (compared to 2011) among this year’s cohort.  However, we will need to continue, as a department, to find ways to better reconnect our junior and senior majors with the content from the courses they take in their first and second years (primarily calculus).

Finally, when comparing BA Mathematics majors enrolled in MTH 254 students with Downers Grove high school students enrolled in MTH 254, we found that the North Central students scored just slightly lower, on average.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, students carried out appropriate problem-solving procedures and/or applied correct formulas, but errors were made in the interpretation of the results.  On the triangle problem for example, a handful of students failed to characterize the triangle as completely as they were asked (perhaps due to not reading the full question), and a few seemed confused on the definition of “isosceles” versus “equilateral”.  (We assume students are familiar with this geometric terminology and therefore spend little time, if any, reviewing these definitions in the calculus sequence.)  Also on the first MTH 254 question, nearly all students were able to figure out that a gradient had to be computed, and they computed it correctly, but then a fair number neglected to multiply the answer by -1 in order to find the direction of maximum decrease (not increase).  \r\n\r\nFinally, we observe that the BA Mathematics majors performed slightly better this year than did the BA Mathematics majors from two years ago who were asked to solve the same problems.\r\n', 'We feel our students’ performance on this assessment was satisfactory, and so we have no plans to change our calculus instruction drastically.  We will continue to teach these courses with a mix of theory and application as these courses serve as both the foundation for all math major and minor programs as well as support for the BS degree in many applied areas.  Applying formulas and procedures correctly is a skill required in both theoretical and applied mathematics, and the data indicates that our students, for the most part, able to decide which formulas and procedures are relevant to solving a particular problem and can carry them out with moderate success.  We will increase our efforts to hone students’ ability to appropriately interpret their results, and when we re-administer this assessment in a few years, we will discuss whether some of the questions should be rephrased for the purposes of clarity.

In MTH 254, the questions were an application of the gradient (routine), computing a double integral (somewhat non-routine), and analyzing the critical points of a multivariable function (routine).  We scored each question on a 0 – 3 scale (based on the correctness of both the solution/decision as well as the correct usage of formulas or procedures to reach the solution), and then we sorted the results according to the students’ major or minor.  The overall averages among North Central students, across all categories, were 2.00 (series), 1.04 (interval of convergence), 1.86 (triangle), 1.37 (gradient), 2.22 (double integral), and 1.89 (critical points).  The averages for just those intending to complete the Actuarial Science major were, respectively, 1.9, 1.13, 2.25, 1.3, 2.4, and 2.0.  By comparison, the averages for the Downers Grove students (MTH 254 questions only) were, respectively, 1.9, 2.4, and 1.93.', 'The Actuarial Science majors’ average scores were at or above our goal of a 75% average (2.25 out of 3) on only 2 out of the 6 questions.  As we anticipated, the average score on the MTH 153 question we identified as “non-routine” was below the averages on the other two “routine” questions; however, we were somewhat surprised at how low these scores were given that students had performed much better on similar questions from the homework and mid-term exam.  On the other hand, the average score on the MTH 254 question we identified as “non-routine” was the only one of the three that was above our goal.  Finally, we noticed that the scores from Actuarial Science majors in MTH 254 were very close to those from the Downers Grove high school students, except on the gradient question (where our students scored somewhat lower). \r\n\r\nIn some instances, students carried out appropriate problem-solving procedures and/or applied correct formulas, but errors were made in the interpretation of the results.  On the triangle problem for example, a handful of students failed to characterize the triangle as completely as they were asked (perhaps due to not reading the full question), and a few seemed confused on the definition of “isosceles” versus “equilateral”.  (We assume students are familiar with this geometric terminology and therefore spend little time, if any, reviewing these definitions in the calculus sequence.)  Also on the first MTH 254 question, nearly all students were able to figure out that a gradient had to be computed, and they computed it correctly, but then a fair number neglected to multiply the answer by -1 in order to find the direction of maximum decrease (not increase).  \r\n\r\nFinally, we observe that the Actuarial Science majors performed somewhat worse this year (by around 0.3 to 0.5 points per question) than did the Actuarial Science majors from two years ago who were asked to solve the same problems.\r\n', 'We feel our students’ performance on this assessment was satisfactory, and so we have no plans to change our calculus instruction drastically.  We will continue to teach these courses with a mix of theory and application as these courses serve as both the foundation for all math major and minor programs as well as support for the BS degree in many applied areas.  Applying formulas and procedures correctly is a skill required in both theoretical and applied mathematics, and the data indicates that our students, for the most part, able to decide which formulas and procedures are relevant to solving a particular problem and can carry them out with moderate success.  We will increase our efforts to hone students’ ability to appropriately interpret their results, and when we re-administer this assessment in a few years, we will discuss whether some of the questions should be rephrased for the purposes of clarity.', '', '2', '2'),

Overall, I was very satisfied with my interactions with the students when we were face-to-face.  The students were able to understand & answer my questions.  The written communication between meetings was less effective but I’m think this has more to do with them not thinking about what might be important to communicate between sessions.\r\n\r\nDuring sessions:\r\n•	Students were relatively quick to figure out how to talk to me as far as technical knowledge and professionally (casual but not buddies).\r\n•	Students were usually able to understand the question I was asking & were able to answer the question at an appropriate level.\r\n•	It was not clear to me who was in charge of what.  Perhaps students could have sat in groups that made it more clear to me what the groups were.  Maybe they were in multiple groups so that is not possible.  Or maybe it would be as simple as giving me an outline of the project & there listing who was in charge of what.\r\n•	The sessions were not generally organized with clear presentations, hand-outs (e.g., an agenda), etc. making the meetings feel less “professional”.  Nobody seemed like they were “in charge” of the meeting. Again, I’m not sure it was necessary, but it might have made it easier for me to hold off on questions when I knew a topic was coming up later.\r\n•	Overall, I thought I got the information I needed.  I thought the students were usually able to hear and understand what I wanted.  I was generally pleased with the overall information exchange during the sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore/Between sessions:\r\n•	Overall, this communication was not very satisfactory.  For the most part it was non-existent.  I think the students did not seem to understand that this was an important part of keeping “the client(s)” well informed.\r\n•	The only real communication that happened between meetings was an e-mail to tell me when the next meeting would be.  This e-mail was often incomplete; it gave only the date & lacked time and place.  No agenda was given.\r\n•	I think it would have been important to have somebody meet with me (& Sandra) early in the term to better understand what I wanted from the product, what my expertise was in the field, and to get a feel for what parts of the program I found extremely important & what parts were less so.  This information could then be transmitted to the rest of the team so they would have some expectations and knowledge of us as clients before we saw the product for the first time.  This also would have been important simply to make us feel more involved in the process.\r\n•	I think it would have made the whole process seem more “professional” if a follow-up e-mail had come out after each session re-capping what the team would be working on, what additional information was needed from us as clients, and a reminder of the time/place for the next meeting.  This would also serve as a good place to start for the next meeting’s agenda.\r\n', 'We expect our 160 students to perform at the adequate level (1) and 161 students slightly higher.  Our 160 students performed slightly below what was expected, but we believe this was due to the mathematical nature of the problem.

In this role, Nancy was asked to assess our students’ communication skills without the use of rubric.  Her feedback gave us some insights into areas we hadn’t thought about including in our rubrics.  Based on her feedback, our students did some things well, but it was interesting to see that they lacked skills in a number of areas required for CS professionals, including leading a group discussion, organizing meetings and keeping users informed.  The group did do very well communicating among themselves, but it was clear they needed work with end users.', 'We don''t believe we need to modify the course requirements for CSC 160 and 161 based on these results.

One in Fall HST 385 (Ilahi), two in Winter  HST 330 (Hoffert), and three in Spring HST 348 (Janacek).  They each wrote a research paper that was used to assess the outcome: “Students should be able to establish a thesis and defend their arguments using primary and/or secondary sources.”', 'Shereen Ilahi organized the data collection, created the rubric, and organized the assessment of the data. The rubric was applied to student research papers that were blinded and coded to distinguish the different courses for which the papers were produced.   Shereen Ilahi and Will Barnett independently evaluated the bibliographies. The scoring was relatively consistent with no significant differences on any one paper. \r\n \r\nWe used a 7 point rubric divided into two parts as follows: Part One - The paper does not establish a thesis (1pt); The paper does establish a thesis, but it is vague, broad or not addressing the “how” or “why”, (2pts); The paper establishes a thesis that is sufficiently specific, narrow or addressing the “how” or “why” part of the argument (3pts). The average score for Part One for all HST minors assessed was score 2.15 out of 3 maximum points.\r\nPart Two of the rubric - The paper does not use any primary and/or secondary sources (1pt); The paper does use primary and/or secondary sources, but dos not connect any of them to the thesis or there is no thesis established (2pts); The paper does use primary and/or secondary sources, and connects some of them to the thesis (3pts);  The paper does use primary and/or secondary sources, and connects most or all of them to the thesis (4pts).  The average score for Part Two for all HST minors assessed was 3.25 out of 4 maximum points.\r\n\r\nThe total score for this outcome adds both parts of the rubric.  The average total score for all HST minors assessed was 5.4 out of 7 maximum points.\r\n', 'The results are generally encouraging, despite the small sample size of the group assessed.  It appears that most of our minors can establish a thesis and they can defend that thesis with primary and secondary sources. However, we noticed that most minors did not use strong thesis statements that are narrow, specific and addressing the “how” or “why” parts of an argument. We also noticed that although most papers were using at least one or more primary source and at least one or more secondary source, some papers tended to rely far too heavily on secondary sources at the expense of primary sources, or some papers tended to rely too heavily on one particular secondary source.
