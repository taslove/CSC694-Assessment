A committee of two CSC faculty members examined the students'' solutions  to see how well they met the two main criteria that are commonly used to characterise the goodness of algorithmic solutions: correctness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe solutions were graded using a rubric for correctness that distinguished 5 levels of correctness. The detailed description of the 5 levels is on file in the CSC department, here I will just mention that level 1 reflected a solution that was incorrect;  level 3 reflected a  solution that was based on the right approach, and the solution, although not correct, could be easily repaired (the incorrectness of the solution stemmed from some oversight, or was a result of some small gaps in the student''s knowledge or understanding);  level 5 reflected a solution that was completely correct, or very nearly so. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe two faculty graders assigned scores of 1 through 5 to various parts of the solutions, in accordance to the rubric.

The result  was an average score of 3.2 on the scale of 1 to 5. \r\n\r\nA similar process was used to grade the efficiency of the students'' solutions. The difference was that the efficiency rubric distinguished three levels of performance: 1, 2, and 3, with level 1 characterising a solution that is innefficient and wasteful of computational resources, level 2 characterising a solution with slight inefficiencies,  and level 3 characterising optimal efficiency. A similar process of averaging yielded an average of  2.5 on a scale of 1 to 3. \r\n\r\n', 'Two of the three students demonstrated good algorithmic problem solving skills. One student did not. Due to the small size of the sample,  the only conclusion we can draw with any degree of confidence is that no significant problems in student learning were uncovered.\r\n\r\nThe two faculty grading the students'' solutions \r\nnoted that those solutions contained minor errors that could have been uncovered if the students had  double-checked the correctness of their solutions, or tested correctness of the same by implementing the solutions and testing them on a computer. \r\n\r\nThe two graders also noted that some of the students''s solutions, even when correct, were hard to follow: that is, they were not clearly expressed.', 'Due to the small size of the sample, we need to collect more data before arriving at specific conclusions.  It is clear, however, that we need to stress the importance of verifying the correctness of a solution, either by proof-theoretic methods, or by computer implementation and testing. Consequently, testing and verification will be stressed in the future when this course is taught.\r\n\r\nOne of the graders noted that while the two questions were appropriate for the level of CSC 540, the problems involved extension of, or applications of,  concepts first studied by students in lower level courses.\r\nNext time the CSC 540 is used to assess this learning outcome, care should be taken to use\r\nquestions that involve  advanced concepts.', '', '2', 0, 1),

In the MTH 280 assessment, we suspect the low scores on the first question indicate that students'' proof instincts are still rather immature (more than we want to see by this point).  On the other hand, the second proof question, which was correctly answered by giving a counterexample, suggests that a majority of our majors are willing and able to use some trial and error to explore the validity of a conjecture.  However, while several students successfully found a counterexample, we would like to have seen more of them include an explanation with their drawing.  Some students seem to be unsure of the distinction between â€œexampleâ€ and â€œevidenceâ€, while others spent valuable time devising unnecessarily complicated counterexamples.  The high success rate on the axiomatic system question indicates that our students have developed deductive reasoning skills that they can apply to solve a logical puzzle not related directly to the math content in the course.\r\n	\r\nIn the MTH 300 assessment, students seemed, for the most part, able to apply a familiar definition in an unfamiliar setting, but what surprised us is that many mistakes could be attributed to rusty calculus skills.  The poor performance on the proof-writing questions highlights the fact that MTH 300 students are in the middle of a transition at this point in the major, and that we need to find ways to help them get through that transition more quickly and more successfully.  The high scores on the axiomatic system question (which included a complete list of steps students could choose from) provide evidence that our students are somewhat comfortable using trial-and-error to (at least begin to) assemble a correct sequence of logical steps that would prove a result in which they were provided a complete list of allowable steps from which to choose.\r\n', 'For both classes we need stress to our students more emphatically that, as far as upper level math goes, often the justification is more important than the final answer.  Students seem hesitant, at first, to adapt to this notion because theyâ€™ve been trained that simply getting the correct answer is all that is important in mathematics. \r\n\r\nIf we use a similar assessment tool next year, we will likely keep the same types of questions, but work on some of the wording so that students can more easily understand what is being asked and can give us a better idea of their strengths and weaknesses in abstract thinking and proof writing.  \r\n\r\nSince time seemed to be an issue for some students we might look into alternative assessment methods for this learning outcome that will allow us to measure our majorâ€™s ability to put together a coherent argumentative (which is not necessarily best accomplished in a short amount of time).  The MTH 280 instructor may introduce some extra credit â€œgoing beyond questionsâ€ in the Reading Checks in order to give students some practice with quickly interpreting new ideas.\r\n', '', '2', 0, 1),

The Non-routine sub score, while improved from past years, remains well below what we would like.  \r\nWe are particularly concerned with low performance on Calculus problems.  Informal discussions with our upper level majors and among the departmental faculty, together with evidence from the ETS test, seem to suggest that students are not successfully retaining their Calculus content, the bulk of which is covered relatively early in the mathematics major.\r\nOur goal stated in the assessment plan was to, over time, raise all percentiles to 75% or better.

The assessment in MTH 280 was included on the final exam; in MTH 300 it was administered at the end of a class period and not included in the course grade.  This, along with the fact that MTH 300 students had only 15 minutes to complete the questions (as opposed to an amount of time during the final exam period decided on by individual MTH 280 students), could explain the high number of blank responses on the MTH 300 questions.  This makes it difficult to come to any reliable conclusions regarding proof-writing for the math minors in MTH 300.   In MTH 280, the minorsâ€™ averaged (significantly) higher on the proof-writing questions than the BA math majors (this was somewhat unexpected) but slightly lower than the BS math majors, while on the logical thinking questions, the minors scored below both the BA and BS majors.  In MTH 300, as we expected based on comparative performance levels on homework, exams, etc., our minorsâ€™ scores were below those of our majors on the assessment questions; this could be explained by the fact that math majors â€“ but not minors - are required to take MTH 280 (although MTH 280 is a highly recommended pre-requisite for MTH 300).', 'In order to solve the â€œblank-responseâ€ issue in the MTH 300 assessment, we will plan to make future assessment questions for minors (and majors) carry small weight in the course grade.

We will try to incorporate some logic puzzle practice in MTH 280 in order to boost our studentsâ€™ performance above our goals; students seem to like these exercises and there is growing evidence that working on these abstract problems improves both logical thinking and proof construction abilities.

Declines in other sub-scores, while somewhat disappointing, are still in line with historical trends for our majors over the last several years.  The slightly higher scores of the BS math majors compared with the BA math majors and certification students could be due to the fact that these students take more math courses at the 300- and 400-level and are thus exposed to more advanced concepts. ', 'As pointed out in our APPC program review a couple of years ago, the BA math major is somewhat minimal in its mid- and upper-level course requirements.  In response, we formulated a new set of expectations that require BA and BS math majors to take a larger number of math courses at the 300- and 400-level.  These new requirements, which go into effect starting with the 2010-2011 catalog, will introduce our majors to a wider range of subject areas, will build upon and reinforce the fundamentals from the calculus and algebra, and has the potential to improve studentsâ€™ proficiency in tackling non-routine problems (due, in part, to their participation in the problem-solving seminar (MTH 375)).  A recently-proposed strategy for improving our majorsâ€™ low performance on non-routine problems (which was detected in other 2009 â€“ 2010 assessment reports) is for department members to compile a long list of problems, both routine and non-routine, from courses throughout the major that our students should submit solutions for before they graduate, much like a portfolio.   Finally, an idea we have already discussed â€“ but not yet acted upon â€“ is to require our majors to serve as tutors or preceptors in our calculus courses in order to help them retain and strengthen their knowledge of calculus.

The report from ETS shows that our majorsâ€™ average scaled mean score (ASMS) was 160 on a scale of 120 â€“ 200, which is a slight decrease from last yearâ€™s average of 166, but comparable to results from prior years (157 in 2008, 149 in 2007, 159 in 2006, and 154 in 2005).  When the 11 students in 2010 are sorted into BA Math Majors (6), BS Math Majors (3), and â€œcertification onlyâ€ students (2), the averages within each subgroup are 159, 164, and 160 (respectively).  There were decreases in studentsâ€™ performance in most subfields with the one exception being the calculus sub-score which has steadily increased over the past few years to, most recently, 42% (up from 39% last year).  The algebra sub-score fell to 37% (down 4% from the previous year) and the applied math sub-score fell to 43% (down 3% from last year, but still up 9% from 2008).  We also saw declines in both the routine problems sub-score (39% in 2010 compared to 43% in 2009) and the non-routine problems sub-score (30% in 2010 compared to 36% in 2009).  ', 'Although our sample size was quite small, we feel that some meaningful conclusions can be drawn.  The ASMS scaled mean score of our majors has hovered close to the 50th percentile nationally over the past several years.  We are encouraged by the steady increase in the calculus sub-score, which is nearing our across-the-board goal of at 50% in all sub-scores.  Declines in other sub-scores, while somewhat disappointing, are still in line with historical trends for our majors over the last several years.  The slightly higher scores of the BS math majors compared with the BA math majors and certification students could be due to the fact that these students take more math courses at the 300- and 400-level and are thus exposed to more advanced concepts.', 'As pointed out in our APPC program review a couple of years ago, the BA math major is somewhat minimal in its mid- and upper-level course requirements.  In response, we formulated a new set of expectations that require BA and BS math majors to take a larger number of math courses at the 300- and 400-level.  These new requirements, which go into effect starting with the 2010-2011 catalog, will introduce our majors to a wider range of subject areas, will build upon and reinforce the fundamentals from the calculus and algebra, and has the potential to improve studentsâ€™ proficiency in tackling non-routine problems (due, in part, to their participation in the problem-solving seminar (MTH 375)).  A recently-proposed strategy for improving our majorsâ€™ low performance on non-routine problems (which was detected in other 2009 â€“ 2010 assessment reports) is for department members to compile a long list of problems, both routine and non-routine, from courses throughout the major that our students should submit solutions for before they graduate, much like a portfolio.   Finally, an idea we have already discussed â€“ but not yet acted upon â€“ is to require our majors to serve as tutors or preceptors in our calculus courses in order to help them retain and strengthen their knowledge of calculus.

For the MTH 341 question, one student failed to properly find the appropriate value of &#955;, and then used a binomial distribution instead of the multinomial distribution for computing the probability of defects.  The other student correctly calculated the value of &#955;, but also used an incorrect formula (which appeared to be a hybrid of the binomial and the multinomial distribution) for the defect probability.  For the MTH 342 question, each student attempted to compute the probability density function using (a different) one of 3 possible methods, but each made errors in obtaining the necessary bounds of integration.  Both students followed proper procedures for computing the expected value; however their final answers were wrong due to carry-over mistakes from the first part of the problem.

It is difficult to conclude with any certainty (especially because of the small sample size) whether these errors were due to a misreading of these particular questions (when under the time pressure of taking a final exam) or an inability to reliably detect subtle, but important, details in multi-step problems.', 'Since our applied math majors seem able to use the right concepts to complete applications, but tend to miss subtle details and/or make errors in execution, we will apply the adage â€œpractice makes perfectâ€ and encourage or require our students to work more problems outside of class to build computational precision.

Except for the logic/application question, the Actuarial Science students, on average, scored above their classmates in MTH 300 and significantly above their classmates in MTH 280.  \r\nOnly two of the Actuarial Science students in MTH 300 were enrolled in MTH 280 the previous term.  MTH 280 focuses specifically on developing abstract mathematical thinking and writing skills.  As MTH 280 is only a recommended prerequisite for MTH 300, many students have their first exposure to proof writing in MTH 300; this is particularly true for Actuarial Science majors who are not required to take MTH 280.  It is therefore not wholly unexpected that their averages on the proof-writing questions were lower than our target scores.  Simply put, students often need more than 10 weeks to develop reliably good proof-writing skills.\r\nWe did change the assessment format in MTH 300 this year by putting the assessment questions on the final exam.  Compared with prior years, we saw far fewer blank responses on the proof-writing questions.  Thus, we are confident that the data we collected this year, more so than in past years, is more meaningful and representative of our studentsâ€™ understanding of the skills they were tested on.\r\n', 'The math department revised the learning outcomes in all of our programs last year after we submitted assessment plans based on the old outcomes.  While we expect all students majoring or minoring in math department programs (Mathematics, Actuarial Science, Applied Mathematics) to be exposed to at least a minimal amount of abstract reasoning, the department faculty decided to remove the â€œproof-writingâ€ portion of the assessed learning outcome in Actuarial Science, and to fold the â€œcompleting applicationsâ€ part into another learning outcome.  We felt that proof-writing was not a sufficiently substantial component of the Actuarial Science program to be one of the learning outcomes. \r\nWhen we assess learning outcomes in the future using student responses, we will continue to put the assessment questions on an exam or tell students that their answers will be scored and used as a small factor in computing their course grade.  We have noticed that this encourages students to take the assessment more seriously and it results in fewer blank responses.\r\n', '', '2', 0, 1),

The outcome we wanted to assess is â€œStudents should be able to use appropriate software and technology to aid in computation and visualization.â€  We originally planned to â€œevaluate responses to two or three questions on the MTH 256 final exam that involve using Maple (a computer algebra system) to solve differential equations, visualize solutions and explain/interpret the outcome of numerical calculations.â€  After more comprehensive consideration for the overall goals of this course, we decided to drop the part of â€œusing Maple to solve differential equationsâ€ and instead focus on the ability to â€œreadâ€ the graph (i.e. visualization and the interpretation part of the learning outcome).  \r\n\r\nInstead of using two or three different questions on the final exam, we used one question with four parts to cover all aspects.  This question is about reading three graphs related with the solution of a second order linear differential equation.  The phase plane is given in the graph a), the time series graph of x(t) is given in the graph b) and the time series graph of x''(t) is given in the graph c).  The questions were\r\n\r\na. Mark on the phase portrait the starting point (where t=0) for the trajectory shown.\r\nb. Add arrows for the direction on the trajectory.\r\nc. Write down the initial condition x(0), x''(0).\r\nd. Find the explicit solutions for x(t).\r\ne. Describe how the time series graph of x(t) relates to its explicit solution, especially where its behavior changes and what happens as t approaches infinity.\r\n\r\nOut of 14 possible points, the 8 students'' scores were, respectively, 6, 4, 13, 11, 14, 12, 12, 13; this averages to a 76% success rate.\r\n\r\nParts a) â€“ c) involve visualization of the numerical solutions in different graphs.  Students need to understand how the algebraic solutions are expressed in various numerical and graphical forms.  It seems most of students understand the connection and are able to â€œreadâ€ the information from the graphs.  Part d) can be done either manually or by Maple, but most of students have done it manually.  Part e) is the most sophisticated part.  Most students could understand the general idea of how these three graphs linked together to reflect the nature of the solution, but only one answered the question adequately to get the full credit on it.  There is one student who had no idea of what these graphs said, another gleaned only a little relevant information from the graphs.\r\n', 'We reached our target of getting 75% in the score.  This demonstrated that we covered this area adequately in this class.  Students walk away from this class having increased understanding in the nature of solutions to differential equations, and how various graphs fit together to tell the whole story of the solutions.   We will keep using Maple in MTH 256 so that our math minors will be exposed to this powerful tool of problem solving and analysis.  The reason we did not emphasize using Maple to solve differential equations is more of assessment problem.  Maple is very powerful in solving differential equations; if Maple is allowed on the exam to solve differential equations, students will not need to learn much else in order to pass the exams.  But learning to investigate differential equations analytically has its own virtues which cannot be replaced by using Maple.   We will need to consider how to balance teaching mathematical thinking, symbolic manipulation and using technology in a more general way.  Maple can take derivatives, but we still teach and test students to do them manually in Calculus I.  Maple can integrate, we still teach and test students to do them manually in Calculus II.  The question goes beyond this one course.', 'We will need to have departmental wide discussion on our goals in using technology in each course and how the technology contributes to conceptual understanding and mathematical maturity of students.

Although the math majors we assessed this year (with the Major Field Test in Mathematics) all began under previous catalogs, many of them took some of the advanced courses we added to the math major (such as Differential Equations, Complex Variables, Topology, and the Problem Solving Seminar), and this may be one reason for the 11-point increase in the ASMS (compared to 2011) among this yearâ€™s cohort.

On the triangle problem for example, a handful of students failed to characterize the triangle as completely as they were asked (perhaps due to not reading the full question), and a few seemed confused on the definition of â€œisoscelesâ€ versus â€œequilateralâ€.

The overall averages among North Central students, across all categories, were 2.00 (series), 1.04 (interval of convergence), 1.86 (triangle), 1.37 (gradient), 2.22 (double integral), and 1.89 (critical points).  The averages for just those intending to complete the Actuarial Science major were, respectively, 1.9, 1.13, 2.25, 1.3, 2.4, and 2.0.  By comparison, the averages for the Downers Grove students (MTH 254 questions only) were, respectively, 1.9, 2.4, and 1.93.', 'The Actuarial Science majorsâ€™ average scores were at or above our goal of a 75% average (2.25 out of 3) on only 2 out of the 6 questions.  As we anticipated, the average score on the MTH 153 question we identified as â€œnon-routineâ€ was below the averages on the other two â€œroutineâ€ questions; however, we were somewhat surprised at how low these scores were given that students had performed much better on similar questions from the homework and mid-term exam.  On the other hand, the average score on the MTH 254 question we identified as â€œnon-routineâ€ was the only one of the three that was above our goal.  Finally, we noticed that the scores from Actuarial Science majors in MTH 254 were very close to those from the Downers Grove high school students, except on the gradient question (where our students scored somewhat lower). \r\n\r\nIn some instances, students carried out appropriate problem-solving procedures and/or applied correct formulas, but errors were made in the interpretation of the results.  On the triangle problem for example, a handful of students failed to characterize the triangle as completely as they were asked (perhaps due to not reading the full question), and a few seemed confused on the definition of â€œisoscelesâ€ versus â€œequilateralâ€.  (We assume students are familiar with this geometric terminology and therefore spend little time, if any, reviewing these definitions in the calculus sequence.)  Also on the first MTH 254 question, nearly all students were able to figure out that a gradient had to be computed, and they computed it correctly, but then a fair number neglected to multiply the answer by -1 in order to find the direction of maximum decrease (not increase).  \r\n\r\nFinally, we observe that the Actuarial Science majors performed somewhat worse this year (by around 0.3 to 0.5 points per question) than did the Actuarial Science majors from two years ago who were asked to solve the same problems.\r\n', 'We feel our studentsâ€™ performance on this assessment was satisfactory, and so we have no plans to change our calculus instruction drastically.  We will continue to teach these courses with a mix of theory and application as these courses serve as both the foundation for all math major and minor programs as well as support for the BS degree in many applied areas.  Applying formulas and procedures correctly is a skill required in both theoretical and applied mathematics, and the data indicates that our students, for the most part, able to decide which formulas and procedures are relevant to solving a particular problem and can carry them out with moderate success.  We will increase our efforts to hone studentsâ€™ ability to appropriately interpret their results, and when we re-administer this assessment in a few years, we will discuss whether some of the questions should be rephrased for the purposes of clarity.', '', '2', 0, 1),

Overall, I was very satisfied with my interactions with the students when we were face-to-face.  The students were able to understand & answer my questions.  The written communication between meetings was less effective but Iâ€™m think this has more to do with them not thinking about what might be important to communicate between sessions.\r\n\r\nDuring sessions:\r\nâ€¢	Students were relatively quick to figure out how to talk to me as far as technical knowledge and professionally (casual but not buddies).\r\nâ€¢	Students were usually able to understand the question I was asking & were able to answer the question at an appropriate level.\r\nâ€¢	It was not clear to me who was in charge of what.  Perhaps students could have sat in groups that made it more clear to me what the groups were.  Maybe they were in multiple groups so that is not possible.  Or maybe it would be as simple as giving me an outline of the project & there listing who was in charge of what.\r\nâ€¢	The sessions were not generally organized with clear presentations, hand-outs (e.g., an agenda), etc. making the meetings feel less â€œprofessionalâ€.  Nobody seemed like they were â€œin chargeâ€ of the meeting. Again, Iâ€™m not sure it was necessary, but it might have made it easier for me to hold off on questions when I knew a topic was coming up later.\r\nâ€¢	Overall, I thought I got the information I needed.  I thought the students were usually able to hear and understand what I wanted.  I was generally pleased with the overall information exchange during the sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore/Between sessions:\r\nâ€¢	Overall, this communication was not very satisfactory.  For the most part it was non-existent.  I think the students did not seem to understand that this was an important part of keeping â€œthe client(s)â€ well informed.\r\nâ€¢	The only real communication that happened between meetings was an e-mail to tell me when the next meeting would be.  This e-mail was often incomplete; it gave only the date & lacked time and place.  No agenda was given.\r\nâ€¢	I think it would have been important to have somebody meet with me (& Sandra) early in the term to better understand what I wanted from the product, what my expertise was in the field, and to get a feel for what parts of the program I found extremely important & what parts were less so.  This information could then be transmitted to the rest of the team so they would have some expectations and knowledge of us as clients before we saw the product for the first time.  This also would have been important simply to make us feel more involved in the process.\r\nâ€¢	I think it would have made the whole process seem more â€œprofessionalâ€ if a follow-up e-mail had come out after each session re-capping what the team would be working on, what additional information was needed from us as clients, and a reminder of the time/place for the next meeting.  This would also serve as a good place to start for the next meetingâ€™s agenda.\r\n', 'We expect our 160 students to perform at the adequate level (1) and 161 students slightly higher.
